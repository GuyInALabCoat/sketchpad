# sketchpad website

Basic dynamic and interactive website with grid of squares where users can "sketch" by hovering their cursor over the squares.

Upon reset, the grid will be drawn to size according to user input.

The grid itself is responsive and scales correctly to screens of any size.

Note: As a result of the fact that the user input queried through a prompt, the browser will interrupt on the second reset to prevent the user from interacting with the grid. When this occurs, simply reload the page.
